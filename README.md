# F20SC-CW1-Browser
 
## Purpose
The aim of this project was to develop a simple web browser in C#, capable of sending HTTP request messages for URLs entered and receiving HTTP response messages without using the C# WebBrowser class, instead performing the HTTP-level communcation directly from within the code. By accomplishing this I was able to understand a greater range of programming languages and knowledge of the features of different languages

## Functionalities
- Sending HTTP request message
- Receiving HTTP response message
  - Display HTTP response status code and corresponding error message (i.e. 400 Bad Request)
- Home page initialisation and edit ability
- Favourite web pages list
- History
- Bulk Download, retrieving pages listed in a file and display the result of its HTTP status code and size of web page
- Simple GUI
