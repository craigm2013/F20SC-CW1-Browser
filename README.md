# F20SC-CW1-Browser
 
## Purpose
The aim of this project was to develop a simple web browser in C#, capable of sending HTTP request messages for URLs entered and receiving HTTP response messages without using the C# WebBrowser class, instead performing the HTTP-level communcation directly from within the code. By accomplishing this I was able to understand a greater range of programming languages and knowledge of the features of different languages
